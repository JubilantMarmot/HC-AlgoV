# JubilantMarmot's simple algorithm visualizer (or AlgoV) version 2

This is a simple web app that allows you to visualize two graph search algorithms: Dijkstra's Algorithm and A* Algorithm.

It uses graphviz to render the graph, and the algorithms are implemented in JavaScript. The graph is represented as an adjacency matrix.

## Features

- Draw a graph by clicking on the canvas
- Export the graph as a JSON file
- Import a graph from a JSON file

## How to use

1. Draw a graph by clicking on the canvas
2. Click on the "Export Graph" button to save the graph as a JSON file
3. Click on the "Import" button to load a graph from a JSON file
